Design Notes:

Types of Questions:
Multiple choice: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which only one may be chosen and only one answer is correct
Checkbox: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which any number may be chosen; there is one correct combination of choices
True/False: a question that has a true/false answer

Design Considerations:
1. What do these types of questions have in common?

needs user input -- could use letters to correspond to answers
needs right answer(s)
has multiple choices
needs to display question
needs to display answers
needs to check correctness of user input


2. What makes these question types different?

multiple choice:
more than 2 choices, 1 answer
could be string or button input

checkbox:
more than 2 choices, could be more than 1 answer
button input only

true/false:
only 2 choices (binary)
could be string input or button input
